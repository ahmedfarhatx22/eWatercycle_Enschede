    "If you want to contribute to `PyStemmusScope`, we recommend installing the package in editable mode. The instructions below will guide you though the steps required.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the package `dependencies` and `optional dependencies` in the `pyproject.toml` file in the root directory of the repository. The package dependecies are those packages that are required to build the package as a software. The optional dependencies are those packages that are required to run the tests, build the documentation, and format the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installation in editable mode\n",
    "\n",
    "First, clone this repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE_Processing.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then install the package (On Windows, use `python` instead of `python3`):\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd STEMMUS_SCOPE_Processing`\n",
    "`python3 -m install -e .[dev]`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Running tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing framework used here is [PyTest](). You can run tests as (On Windows, use `python` instead of `python3`):\n",
    "\n",
    "`python3 -m pytest`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Building the documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the documentation dependencies (On Windows, use `python` instead of `python3`):\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd STEMMUS_SCOPE_Processing`\n",
    "`python3 -m install -e .[docs]`\n",
    "\n",
    "To edit the documentation locally, do:\n",
    "\n",
    "`mkdocs serve`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then open the local hyperlink displayed in the terminal, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "`INFO     -  [13:23:44] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Run formatting tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting configs are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file. You can use `ruff` to get information about errors, potential problems and convention violations. To run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ruff check .`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to fix some of the errors automatically. To do so, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ruff check --fix .`\n",
    "\n",
    "To format the import statements, you can use `isort` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`isort`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### BMI Developer instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python BMI implemented in this package communicates with the Matlab code through STDIN/STDOUT, or via a socket to the Docker container. Over this interface, three commands can be sent to Matlab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `initialize \"path_to_cfg_file.txt\"`\n",
    "2. `update`\n",
    "3. `finalize`\n",
    "\n",
    "After the initialize and update steps, the Matlab process writes the state of any BMI exposed variables to an hdf5-file in the directory of `OutputPath` as defined in the configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python BMI interfaces with this file to allow the variables to be read and set.\n",
    "\n"

    "**Adding/changing exposed variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Step one of changing the exposed variables is to change the Matlab code and generating a new MCR executable (and possibly Docker image). The exposed variables are defined in [STEMMUS_SCOPE/src/STEMMUS_SCOPE_exe.m](https://github.com/EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE/blob/main/src/STEMMUS_SCOPE_exe.m). Under the `bmiVarNames` variable. Make sure that you add the model variable here, as well as any info on the variable's grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available variable names (`MODEL_INPUT_VARNAMES`, `MODEL_OUTPUT_VARNAMES`), their units (`VARNAME_UNITS`), datatypes (`VARNAME_DTYPE`) and grids (`VARNAME_GRID`) are defined in constants at the top of the file `PyStemmusScope/bmi/implementation.py`. These have to be updated to reflect the changes in the state file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly you have to update the `get_variable` and `set_variable` functions in `PyStemmusScope/bmi/implementation.py`. Here you define how the python code can access them. While writing the code you can inspect the state using `model.state`, which allows you to view the full contents of the HDF5 file for easier debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the BMI changes, a new [STEMMUS_SCOPE Docker image](https://github.com/EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE/pkgs/container/stemmus_scope) should be released that is compatible with the new BMI implementation. A new release usually includes a new tag. Then, you need to update the compatible_tags variable of the class `StemmusScopeDocker` in `PyStemmusScope/bmi/docker_process.py`."
